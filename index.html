As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<span style = 'text-decoration :underline'>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
<span style ='background : orange'>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<span style= 'color:red;font-weight: bold'>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
<span style ='color: red; font-weight: bold'> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole beng like the flame of a lamp, even whem he is asleep..."</span>
And i felt him to be more fragile still
<span style = 'text-decoration : underline'> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
